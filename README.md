# Data Incubator Q3

## Data Science in Health Field

### Motivation
I would be participate in Data Science project in the health field. 
As a doctoral student in Bioinformatics, my academic research focus
on deconvoluting the ensembled genomic data and learn genome structural 
subtypes among population. Then in industrial world, I would focus on
the application of data science to provide better health insights.

### Introduction
Propose a project to do while at The Data Incubator. 
Here I want to know the ability to think at a high level. 
Try to think of projects that users or businesses will care about.
I would like to work on the data science project to analyze data from
medical monitoring devices and more generally, wireless wearable fitness devices. 

It is hard to find large volume public fitness data, such as walking, vital signals.
Here I just show a toy demo with available one user Fitbit data of walking and sleeping activity colletec in one year. 
The data is from Alket Cecaj, the post in his blog Algorithms and Data Fusion:

Data sets of any type: some links, the 15th bullet point of the post.
